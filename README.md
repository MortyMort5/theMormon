The frameworks that are being used are UIKIT to which handles the UIImage data that is being brought down from the API. 
This project is using UserDefault to cache all the data locally. I used UserDefault to persist to the phone because 
there wasn't a lot of data that was being brought down from the API and because there wasn't a lot of complex tasks
I needed to run after it was cached. I didn't use any third party libraries for the parsing of the data since it wasn't 
super complex and I was trying to keep it super simple and basic.
